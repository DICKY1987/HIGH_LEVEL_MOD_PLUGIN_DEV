● I've read the file. This is a comprehensive architectural analysis document for the File-Watcher-Git-Pipeline
  system, detailing a complete plugin-based architecture with modular components.

  Document Structure Overview

  PART A: PLUGIN SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
  - Plugin lifecycle management (discovery → validation → loading → activation → deactivation)
  - 12+ extension hooks across the Git pipeline (onFileDetected, beforeStage, afterCommit, beforePush, etc.)
  - Plugin manifest structure with permissions model
  - Hook context services (git, logger, config, state)
  - Safety mechanisms: timeouts, circuit breakers, error isolation

  PART B: COMPLETE MODULAR ARCHITECTURE

  Tier 1 - Core Modules (10): Event Watcher, Dispatcher, Pipeline Orchestrator, Git Adapter, State Store, Config
  Manager, Conflict Resolver, Security/Policy Engine, Audit/Observability, CLI/Daemon Manager

  Tier 2 - Plugin Modules (8): Secrets Scanner, Lint/Format, File Router, Commit Message Generator, Notifications,
  Backup/Archive, Auto-Merge Strategy, Compliance Gate

  Tier 3 - Support Modules (5): Logging/Tracing, Metrics/Health, Schema Validation, FS Utilities, Test Harness

  PART C: PLUGIN ECOSYSTEM & DEVELOPMENT
  - Plugin creation workflow with scaffolding tools
  - Testing framework with mock contexts
  - Version compatibility matrix

  PART D: ARCHITECTURAL ANALYSIS
  - Strengths: Event-driven design, clear separation, safety mechanisms
  - Limitations: Same-process isolation, ordering complexity
  - Comparison matrix vs Git hooks and CI-based sync

  Key Features

  ✅ Hook-based extension system with 12+ lifecycle hooks✅ Permission-based capability model for plugins✅ Circuit
  breakers and timeouts for resilience✅ Policy-as-gates enforcement (secrets, lint, compliance)✅ Complete contract
   specifications with schemas

  Would you like me to analyze any specific aspect, extract implementation patterns, or help integrate this with the
   versioned documentation system described in your CLAUDE.md?

● I'll create a comprehensive plan to implement the File-Watcher-Git-Pipeline system as a standalone module with a
  TUI interface. Let me first explore the codebase to understand the current state.
